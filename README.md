# Weather-Dashboard
##  :page_with_curl: Project Description
In this app, the user enters the name of a city in the search field, then clicks the search button. The app will display the current weather conditions in that city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and a picture representing whether it is clear, cloudy, raining, etc. Additionally, a 5-day forecast for that city is displayed below the current conditions showing similar information.
Every time a user searches for a city, a button displaying that search information is created underneath the search field. When the user clicks on that button, a new search is executed for that location.
